I'm Lloyd Thomas, Programmer in Web and Game Development, and 
Electrical & Electronic Engineering Student.

My background is mostly Computer studies and practices, as a Programmer
in Web and Games, using languages such as: JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Java
and Ruby. I studied for 4 years at Swansea University in Computer Science (BSc).

Web frameworks and/or libraries that aid in development that I am familiar with
could be: Rails, Node, Spring Boot for Web, some things like DirectX for Graphics Programming
for games. Game Engine of choice for myself in development is UE4.

I have recently started to express my interests in Robotics, and program hardware manually, 
using control board altering software such as Arduino, and programming languages like C++,
to give the hardware new instructions. 

In particular I express interests in Design and Prototyping circuits of Robotics, and to 
be able to program the hardware myself.
