I'm Lloyd Thomas, Physics Student (BSc) & Software Developer in Games, Web & App Development.

Gathering the relevant abilities and experience, knowledge and my nature of breakthrough of work, I am able to produce very clean and robust code, that does exactly what is desired, necessary and efficient, just as much as humanly readable software - and furthermore reusable and extendable.

I am heavily conditioned in both Video Game Programming, Website Development (Full-Stack), and in recent days acquired Mobile App Development - Android. 

I've also had experience making Electronics programs for hardware like the Arduino Uno and for a Lego Mindstorms robot, using a C-based language to write it's code.

That said, I furthermore have a lot of hands-on implementations of gameplay systems over modules written for the use of Graphics, textures and shaders and so on, but at least know how to use them side by side.

I also understand each stage of producing single-page web apps, using something like React, or instead Vue using an MVC controlled server application, like PHP using Laravel or .NET. 

Overall I am a great team player, that is able to work alone, or be an approachable person to bounce off, should someone else need my help.
