I'm Lloyd Thomas, a Programmer in Web and Games Development.

I have studied for 4 years at Swansea University in Computer Science (BSc), specialising 
in Web Development, then later on accquiring Games Development skills.

My background is mostly Computer studies and practices, as a Programmer, 
using languages such as: JavaScript, PHP, C# and C++. 

I am an ambitious and determined programmer, of which is able to work as an 
individual on separate tasks, as well as being able to work alongside others. My 
work consists of a steady pace of evaluation and assessment of the situation, 
before accurately and efficiently completing each part of the task. 

Having studied computer related courses for 6 years, I have been a practicing 
programmer, inside and outside of education, for 5 years. I have practiced 
developing web applications and websites, as well as video games, using 
modern technologies. 

Overall I am a programmer with a hard work ethic, and I am able to complete a 
given task to the expected standards, while keeping an open mind in terms of 
how to program a certain module to solve a particular problem.
